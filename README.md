#Task01 explaination
so int the task01 we have to create a game where we having a class which is having a function which will randomly genrate a number in the range that we will give
and after that we have while loop in that loop the whole thing i have written if the number which user has given is smaller or greater than that message will me printed otherwise if the number is correctly guessed than that message will printed and at the end of that the rate of winning wil be printed

atlast we will give a choice to user if he or she want to play again or want to quit that if else condition is there,and that is how our task01 is completed.


#Task02
so in the task02 we will ask user for total subject and in a for loop we will ask for the marks which they got in each subject,then we calculate for average marks and for grade we have switch cases a+,a,+b etc...
and that is how Task02 is created.

#Task03
this code simulates a simple ATM system with a BankAccount class and an ATM class. The BankAccount class has methods for checking the balance, depositing, and withdrawing money. The ATM class acts as the user interface, displaying a menu for checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing money. The Task03 class creates an instance of the BankAccount with an initial balance, takes user input for a PIN, and then initializes the ATM with the user's bank account. The user can interact with the ATM by choosing options from the menu, and the system provides feedback on balance, deposits, and withdrawals. The program runs until the user chooses to exit.


#Task04
student management
The Student class encapsulates student details, while the StudentManagementSystem class manages a collection of students with methods for adding, removing, searching, and displaying students. The Task04 class serves as the user interface, providing a console-based menu for users to interact with the system, add/remove students, search for students, and save/load data to/from a file. The program runs continuously until the user chooses to exit, with input validation for user choices.
